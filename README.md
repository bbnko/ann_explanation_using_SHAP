<h1> Explaining predictions and feature contributions in a Tensorflow ANN Model using SHAPley values <h1>


<h3>  
In this notebok a simple ANN Model is built using Tensorflow (Pima Indians Diabetes dataset). Predictions and feature contributions are explained using SHAP library. Various plots, produced by the library, are used to better showcase the exact contrubtion of each feature.
<h3>  

<h3>  
Note: not all plots are displaying correctly in GitHub's notebook preview, but should be visible if opened in Jupyter / VSCode.
